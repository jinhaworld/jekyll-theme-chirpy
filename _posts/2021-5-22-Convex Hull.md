So far from pole to pole.

So short from drop to drop. 

Life trickles as an unconquerable goal,

To only cease at the top. 


To be or not to be. 

It matters not why but how. 

Matters it only to be, 

But stand, we must against the plow. 



Its chains shall not shackle,

For he dies for what matters, 

He may crackle, 

But he shall not chatter. 



Birth, 

Love, 

Rebirth.



Stand above, 

Till trembling at the gate. 

Face he shall the fade,

As keeper of his fate, 

Loving unafraid. 



Eyes of wisdom shall be proof. 

Act we will. 

Ears of bane shall be disproof. 

Live we will.
