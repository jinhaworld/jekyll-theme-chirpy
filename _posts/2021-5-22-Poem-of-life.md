So far from pole to pole.

So short from drop to drop. 

Life trickles as an unconquerable goal,

To only disappear at the top. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

To be or not to be. 

It matters not why but how. 

Matters it only to me. 

But stand, we must against the plow. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Its chains shall not shackle,

For I stand for what matters. 

He may crackle, 

But I shall not chatter. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Birth. 

Love.

Rebirth. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Stand above. 

Till trembling at the gate. 

Face I shall the shade.

As keeper of my fate. 

Loving, fighting, standing unafraid. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Eyes of wisdom is my proof. 

Act I will. 

Ears shall be my disproof. 

Live I will, for and only for my will.
