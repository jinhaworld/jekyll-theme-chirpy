So far from pole to pole.

So short from drop to drop. 

Life trickles as an unconquerable goal,

To only disappear at the top. 


To be or not to be. 

It matters not why but how. 

Matters it only to me. 

But stand, we must against the plow. 



Its chains shall not shackle,

For I stand for what matters. 

He may crackle, 

But I shall not chatter. 



Birth. 

Love.

Rebirth.



Stand above. 

Till trembling at the gate. 

Face I shall the shade.

As keeper of my fate. 

Loving, fighting, standing unafraid. 



Eyes of wisdom is my proof. 

Act I will. 

Ears shall be my disproof. 

Live I will, for and only for my will.
