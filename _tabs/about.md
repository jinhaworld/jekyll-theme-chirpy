## Student at MIT 
To break the ice with you (quite possibly a random person who randomly strolled into my random website), I was born in Masschusetts on December 31st, 2003... with only one issue, that being the 13-hour time difference between Korea and America. So, hey, I got my Korean passport (parents are korean citizen), and it says that I was born on January 1st, 2004. At least for what I know and for what I hope, being born in two different years isn't the sort of thing you can see too often. I mean a typical Korean/American dual citizen would have an age difference of 1, they differ by 2 for me ;(

My passion lies in math and computer science. I would say that I am pretty satisfied to have gone as far as I have over a short span of time, especially in competitive programming where I really was so bad that I had to sink into utter misery everytime I looked at my code. Eventually, going over algorithms, learning applicational aspects of CS in arduino and machine learning, as well as learning higher math, I feel a bit more confident in my coding skills. No worries though, I am full of surprises?
