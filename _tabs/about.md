### CS, Math @ MIT 
>> October 1st, 2021 

Well, as Kurt Vonnegut would say, so it goes... time passes, life passes, and here we are. Over the rather monotone summer, rife with undeniably emptiness and also boredom, I made a promise to myself to write down a couple of things here and there. After all, this is what interested me into organizing this website, and it also sounded exciting to write out my inner thoughts somewhere. 

Sadly, it's now October, and I have not written as much as I wanted to.  Although this website has become a hodge-podge of a wide array of things (studying, life, writing, cs), I hope it will come to grow over time.

It feels very nice to think that someone is actually reading this. It's most likely that I don't know you in real life, but if you do know me, hello and greetings. Otherwise, I can safely assume that you don't know too much about who I am either.  

I guess it's similar to how you expect to learn about someone after reading their blogs, and as the writer, you expect the readers to want to learn about yourself. 

Clearly, as you can tell, I've been bored and probably for a while :)

<!-- I was born in Masschusetts on December 31st, 2003 with one issue, that being the 13-hour time difference between Korea and America. So, I got my Korean passport (parents are korean citizen), and it says that I was born on January 1st, 2004. By all means, being born in two different years isn't the sort of thing you can see too often. I mean a typical Korean / American dual citizen would have an age difference of 1, it differs by 2 for me.  -->

My passion lies in math and computer science. I would say that I am satisfied to have gone as far as I have over the span of time. 

<!-- where I really was so bad that I had to sink into utter misery everytime I looked at my code. It is interesting to note that I seem to be a victim of the initial stages of the dunning-kruger effect but from right to left, not left to right. As with all things, with more time spent attempting to accept any such cognitive bias, I found myself having become quite decent in competitive programming.  -->
