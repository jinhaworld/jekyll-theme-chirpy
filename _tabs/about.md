“Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum" - Rene Descartes 

> Dubito

Well, so it goes, Kurt Vonnegut would say, yet here we are — life is full of wonders. Over the rather monotone summer, rife with essentially and undeniably emptiness, I have come to the revelation that I should write a couple of things here and there.  Be assured, however, that I am completely unaware of what I will write. At the moment, it is a nagging concern in the back of my head that this website has become a hodge-podge of a baffling array of things (studying, life, writing, cs). It most likely is best that I focus on a single thing, particularly for a website like this one. 

Ahh, and so we have reached *dubito.* 

> Cogito 

Hey. Yes you, who strolled into my website :) I only can wonder how (it's quite embarassing actually). Still, let me introduce myself, as per decorum. 

I was born in Masschusetts on December 31st, 2003 with one issue, that being the 13-hour time difference between Korea and America. So, I got my Korean passport (parents are korean citizen), and it says that I was born on January 1st, 2004. By all means, being born in two different years isn't the sort of thing you can see too often. I mean a typical Korean / American dual citizen would have an age difference of 1, it differs by 2 for me. 

I actually had to think for quite a bit to come up with that trivia. It's not as easy as it seems to try coming up with things about yourself that will interest others :p 

Thus, *cogito.* 

> Sum 

My passion lies in math and computer science. I would say that I am pretty satisfied to have gone as far as I have over a short span of time, especially in competitive programming where I really was so bad that I had to sink into utter misery everytime I looked at my code. It is interesting to note that I seem to be a victim of the initial stages of the dunning-kruger effect but from right to left, not left to right.  

As with all things, with more time spent attempting to accept any such cognitive bias, I found myself having become relatively decent in competitive programming. Becoming used to algorithmic reasoning such as loop-invariants to prove correctness and encountering applications, for instance, network flow in software, cs to this day interests me. 

$\exists{\textrm{human}} \notin \textrm{humans}$. 

No worries though, I am full of surprises?  

*Sum.*
