“Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum" - Rene Descartes 

> Dubito

Well, so it goes, as Kurt Vonnegut would say, yet here we are at a singularity — indeed, life is full of wonders. Over the rather monotone summer, rife with undeniably emptiness, I came to a revelation to jot down a couple of things here and there. 

<!-- Be assured, however, that I am unaware of what I will write. At the moment, it really is a nagging concern that this website has become a hodge-podge of a baffling array of things (studying, life, writing, cs). It most likely is best that I focus on a single thing in  particular for a website like this.  -->

Ah, so we have reached *dubito.* 

> Cogito

<!-- Hello dear  

You can probably tell that I am a bit bored. I may even know you irl and you may know me, but maybe not, and so who cares :) I can only wonder what brought you here (it's quite embarassing actually). Nonetheless, let's continue.  -->

I was born in Masschusetts on December 31st, 2003 with one issue, that being the 13-hour time difference between Korea and America. So, I got my Korean passport (parents are korean citizen), and it says that I was born on January 1st, 2004. By all means, being born in two different years isn't the sort of thing you can see too often. I mean a typical Korean / American dual citizen would have an age difference of 1, it differs by 2 for me. 

Thus, *cogito.* 

> Sum 

My passion lies in math and computer science. I would say that I am satisfied to have gone as far as I have over a short span of time, especially in competitive programming. Becoming used to algorithmic reasoning and encountering applications, cs to this day interests me. 

<!-- where I really was so bad that I had to sink into utter misery everytime I looked at my code. It is interesting to note that I seem to be a victim of the initial stages of the dunning-kruger effect but from right to left, not left to right. As with all things, with more time spent attempting to accept any such cognitive bias, I found myself having become quite decent in competitive programming.  --> 

<!-- $\exists{\textrm{human}} \notin \textrm{humans}$.  -->

<!-- No worries though, I am full of surprises?   -->

*Sum.*
