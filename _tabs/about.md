“Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum" - Rene Descartes 

> Dubito

Well, so it goes, as Kurt Vonnegut would say, yet here we are — indeed, life is full of wonders. Over the rather monotone summer, rife with undeniably emptiness and also boredom, I promised myself to write down a couple of things here and there but I think I wrote at max two posts in a month. it's very sadd... 

I have basically no idea of what I will write. At the moment, it is concerning since this website has become a hodge-podge of a baffling array of things (studying, life, writing, cs). It most likely is best that I focus on a single thing for a website like this. 

Ah, so we have reached *dubito.*

Hello dear person, 

You probably won't know, but it really matters a lot to me that you are reading this. It also is slightly embarassing because I don't know what I am writing... You can probably tell that I am a bit bored or maybe just not ok. I may even know you irl and you may know me, but probably not and so who cares :) Have been bored for a long time and probably will still be for a while. 

<!-- I was born in Masschusetts on December 31st, 2003 with one issue, that being the 13-hour time difference between Korea and America. So, I got my Korean passport (parents are korean citizen), and it says that I was born on January 1st, 2004. By all means, being born in two different years isn't the sort of thing you can see too often. I mean a typical Korean / American dual citizen would have an age difference of 1, it differs by 2 for me.  -->

Thus, *cogito.* 

> Sum 

My passion lies in math and computer science. I would say that I am satisfied to have gone as far as I have over a short span of time, especially in competitive programming. 

<!-- where I really was so bad that I had to sink into utter misery everytime I looked at my code. It is interesting to note that I seem to be a victim of the initial stages of the dunning-kruger effect but from right to left, not left to right. As with all things, with more time spent attempting to accept any such cognitive bias, I found myself having become quite decent in competitive programming.  -->

<!-- No worries though, I am full of surprises?   -->

*Sum.*
